      <h2>Globalisation in the Pre-Modern World</h2>

      <p>Globalisation existed long before the modern age, though it was slower and less connected than today. Ancient kingdoms and empires traded goods, exchanged ideas, and spread culture across continents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India’s spices, textiles, and precious stones were famous in Rome and Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>Religions like Buddhism and Islam spread across continents, showing cultural globalisation.</li>
        <li>Empires such as the Roman, Mauryan, and Mongol empires built vast trade networks.</li>
        <li>Caravans, ships, and migrations created connections long before modern tech.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Silk Route and Indentured Labour</h2>

      <p>The Silk Route was a vital trade network connecting China, India, Central Asia, and Europe. Goods like silk, spices, and cotton moved along these routes, as did ideas and diseases like the plague.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India was both a producer and a transit hub along the Silk Route.</li>
        <li>During colonial times, Indian indentured labourers worked in British colonies, spreading culture worldwide.</li>
        <li>They faced harsh contracts but helped globalise Indian food, traditions, and customs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Economic Globalisation (1991 Liberalisation)</h2>

      <p>India’s economic globalisation took off in 1991 with liberalisation reforms opening the economy to foreign investment and trade.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduction of tariffs and trade barriers improved market access.</li>
        <li>IT companies like Infosys and TCS grew rapidly serving global clients.</li>
        <li>Foreign direct investment boosted multiple sectors—automobiles, telecom, retail.</li>

      <h2>Positive and Negative Impact on India</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Globalisation has brought benefits like job creation, foreign investment, expanded choices, and tourism.</li>
        <li>However, small producers face global competition, job security is threatened in traditional sectors, and inequality can increase.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive: Foreign investment, IT growth, consumer choices, cultural spread, tourism.</li>
        <li>Negative: Small producers undercut, job losses in traditional sectors, growing inequality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role of WTO in Promoting Globalisation</h2>
      <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO), established in 1995, encourages free trade and settles disputes, offering India access to global markets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WTO promotes reduction in import duties and market opening.</li>
        <li>Policies can favour developed countries, creating inequality challenges.</li>

      <h2>Regional Impact: Tamil Nadu and Jammu & Kashmir</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tamil Nadu:</strong> A hub for textiles, autos, IT exports, and tourism, but small weavers struggle with cheap imports.</li>
        <li><strong>Jammu & Kashmir:</strong> Increased exports of handicrafts and tourism, but tradition faces threats from machine-made competition and westernisation.</li>
