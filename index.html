      <h2>Globalisation in Pre-Modern World</h2>

      <p>Globalisation existed long before the modern age, though it was slower and less connected than today. Ancient kingdoms and empires traded goods, exchanged ideas, and spread culture across continents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India’s spices, textiles, and precious stones were famous in Rome and Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>The spread of religions like Buddhism and Islam illustrates cultural globalisation.</li>
        <li>Empires such as the Roman, Mauryan, and Mongol empires built vast trade routes.</li>
        <li>Caravans, ships, and migration created connections despite lack of modern transport.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Silk Route and Indentured Labour</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Silk Road visual"/>
      <p>The Silk Route was a vital trade network connecting China, India, Central Asia, and Europe. Goods like silk, spices, and cotton moved along these routes, as did ideas and diseases like the plague.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India was both a producer and a transit hub along Silk Route.</li>
        <li>During colonial times, Indian indentured labourers worked in British colonies spreading culture worldwide.</li>
        <li>They faced harsh contracts but helped globalise Indian food, traditions, and customs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Economic Globalisation (1991 Liberalisation)</h2>

      <p>India’s economic globalisation took off in 1991 with liberalisation reforms opening the economy to foreign investment and trade.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduction of tariffs and trade barriers improved market access.</li>
        <li>IT companies like Infosys and TCS grew rapidly serving global clients.</li>
        <li>Foreign direct investment boosted multiple sectors—automobiles, telecom, retail.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role of Transport and Communication</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494526585095-c41746248156?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Modern transport and communication"/>
      <p>Modern transport and communication technologies are key drivers of globalisation, making movement faster and connecting people instantly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Container ships, airplanes, and railways enable global cargo movement.</li>
        <li>Mobile phones, satellites, and the internet allow real-time global communication.</li>
        <li>Indian professionals work remotely with international companies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Positive and Negative Impact of Globalisation on India</h2>
      <img src="impact-chart.png" alt="Globalisation Impact Chart" style="max-width:600px;width:100%; margin-bottom:1rem"/>
      <p>Globalisation has brought many benefits like job creation and foreign investment, but also challenges for small producers and local workers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive: Foreign investment, IT growth, consumer choices, cultural spread, tourism.</li>
        <li>Negative: Small producers undercut, job losses in traditional sectors, growing inequality.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="wto">
      <h2>Role of WTO in Promoting Globalisation</h2>
      <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO), established in 1995, encourages free trade and settles disputes, offering India access to global markets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WTO promotes reduction in import duties and market opening.</li>
        <li>Policies can favour developed countries, creating inequality challenges.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges in Fair Globalisation</h2>
      <p>Ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, environmental protection, and balanced benefits remain major challenges for India.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Need for skill training and support for small industries</li>
        <li>Stronger international agreements to protect weaker economies</li>
        <li>Inclusive growth and environmental sustainability</li>
      </ul>
